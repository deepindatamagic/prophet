Time Series forecasting with Facebook Prophet

What you will need:

1. A Google Colab account: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. If wanting to forecast stock prices with Alphavantage (as in the example), an Alphavantage API Key: https://www.alphavantage.co/
3. If wanting to use your own Time Series data, upload this to Google Drive (connected to Google Colab)

Notes: 
** remember to connect your Google Drive to Google Colab.
** To use Google Colab, the version of Python needed is the Jupyter Notebooks which has the .ipynb file name extension
** If you have Python installed on your PC/laptop - you can use the .py filename extension
** To be able to use the .py version, you will also need Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
** Visual Studio Code also supports the .ipynb version but you will need to install the support extension - done within Visual Studio Code
